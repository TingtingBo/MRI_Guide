# Linux

You can check to see if you have a GCC complier installed already on your system:

```
#!console
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.4.6 20110731 (Red Hat 4.4.6-3)
Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO

```

# Mac

Open you Xcode.app and go to Xcode > Preferences > Downloads. Click to make sure you have the command line toolbox installed.

If you don't see the library to install, you are probably running a different version of Mac OS X. For Mac OS X Mavericks, type the following in your terminal:

```
#!console
$ xcode-select --install
```


# Windows

(Unfortunately, Windows doesn't come with a default C++ compiler. There are many ways to obtain a GCC compiler. You may also find that your windows computer doesn't come with many other programs that are important for running the cmake process. This is the sensible place to stop downloading things in Windows if you value your sanity. Otherwise you will need to make sure you have Ruby, Python, SWIG, and possibly some other programs.)
